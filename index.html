Any rejection is scored 10 points vs. 1 point for any request that is accepted.</p><p>The player can attempt any kind of social rejection, or try a suggestion from one of the Rejection Therapy suggestion cards available. The game can be played for any length of time, although many undertake the 30 Day Challenge.</p><p>The purpose of playing the game is to overcome the fear of rejection through controlled, forced exposure. By this means, players hope to adapt physically to the stresses of rejection.</p><p><strong>How score counts?</strong> Each accepted entry adds <i>+1</i> and each rejected <i>+10</i>!</p></div><div class="clear"></div><h1>Results</h1><div class="score"><span class="score-span">Score</span> <span class="overall-score"></span></div><ul class="results"></ul></div><script type="text/javascript" src="js/main.cddc8d1a656dd5951d46.js"></script></body></html>
