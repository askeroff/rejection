      <div class="about">
        <p>
          Rejection Therapy is a social self-help game created by Jason Comely where being rejected by another person 
          or group is the sole winning condition. 
          Any rejection is scored 10 points vs. 1 point for any request that is accepted.
        </p>
        <p>
          The player can attempt any kind of social rejection, or try a suggestion from one of the Rejection Therapy 
          suggestion cards available. 
          The game can be played for any length of time, although many undertake the 30 Day Challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of playing the game is to overcome the fear of rejection through controlled, forced exposure.
          By this means, players hope to adapt physically to the stresses of rejection.
